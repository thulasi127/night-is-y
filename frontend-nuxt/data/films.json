Dreaming of DeadMau5 and Daft Punk Stardom, he creates his alter ego ‘Deadpixel;’ and wears a square disco ball he wears on his head.\n\nEncouraged by his best friend and slimy manager Kyle to pursue this alter-ego, ‘Deadpixel’ becomes Toronto-famous, garnering attention from promoters, girls and fellow EDM scenesters. The new spotlight sparks tension between the two friends as they quest for DJ-fandom in a city full of artists.\n\nEach season of That's My DJ follows a different character within the electronic music scene in Toronto. From heartbeat to heartbreak, chasing dreams and chasing highs, it's an unapologetic look at music, cliques and artists all trying to find their place within the new order of rave.",
