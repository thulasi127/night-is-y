    "summary": "The Hoof Lady is a bold Indigenous-led visual novel that reimagines a chilling Mohawk legend through a contemporary, feminist, and 2SLGBTQ+ lens. Rooted in cultural storytelling and grounded in modern realities, the series follows Hawi, a naive but determined young Indigenous woman with horse hooves for feet and a warrior spirit brewing within her. Set in Kahnaw√†:ke and stretching into man camps and cityscapes, this supernatural thriller unpacks systemic violence, sexual abuse, MMIWG2S, intergenerational trauma, and the colonial entanglements of policing and resource extraction.",
